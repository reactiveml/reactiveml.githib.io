In this example, time will be only logical to avoid interactions
with the operating system. To see how to logical time can be linked to
physical time, the interested reader can see the <a href="http://reactiveml.org/reactive_asco">Reactive Asco example</a>.

So, first, we need a process that waits for a given
duration <code>d</code> expressed in number of logical steps and at least one.
</p>

<p><pre class="code">
let process sleep d =
  for i = 1 to d do
    pause;
  done
  || pause
</pre></p>

<p>
Using this process, we can define the ring tone, a process that
prints <code>Bip Bip Bip Bip</code> periodically on the standard
output.
</p>

<p><pre class="code">
let process bipbipbipbip =
     loop
       for i = 1 to 4 do
      	 print_string "Bip "; flush stdout;
      	 run sleep 10;
       done;
       run sleep 100;
       print_newline ()
      end
</pre></p>
