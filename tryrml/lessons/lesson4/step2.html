<p>
This two states automaton can be implemented with two mutually
recursive processes.  Transitions are triggered by the emission of
signals <code>switch_on</code> and <code>switch_off</code>. The
initial state is <code>state_off</code>.
</p>

<p><pre class="code">
let process light switch_on switch_off =

  let rec process state_on =
    do
      print_endline "Light on!";
      halt
    until switch_off -> run state_off
    done

  and process state_off =
    do
      print_endline "Light off!";
      halt
    until switch_on -> run state_on
    done

  in
  run state_off
</pre></p>

<p>
When a state becomes active, the message <code>Light on!</code>
or <code>Light off!</code> is displayed.
</p>
