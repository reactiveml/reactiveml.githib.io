It is very easy to make our two automata communicate through
a third one. For instance we can switch on the light when the alarm is
ringing, and switch off the light when the alarm is snoozed or turned
off.

The idea is to write a one state automaton that listens to the control
signals of the alarm clock and emits control signals of the light.

let rec process light_clock =
  do
    halt
  until
  | ck_off ->
      emit switch_off;
      run light_clock
  | ck_bip ->
      emit switch_on;
      run light_clock
  | ck_snooze ->
      emit switch_off;
      run light_clock
  done
</pre></p>
