<h1>Example of a Glonemo simulation</h1>

<h2>The example</h2>

The goal of the network is to detect a radioactive cloud. The cloud, modeled in Lucky is a disk.
<br>
The routing layer is directed diffusion. (See <a href="http://www.isi.edu/scadds/projects/diffusion.html"></a> for more information)
<br>
The MAC layer is a preamble sampling mac protocol.

The color of the nodes indicates in which mode (sleep, idle, ...) is their radio.

The cloud is the red disk.
