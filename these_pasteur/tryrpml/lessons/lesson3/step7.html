<p>
We can test our new combinator with a moving point.
</p>
<p><pre class="code">
#run killable (moving_point (new_state ()));;
</pre></p>
<p>
Observe that the id <code>[1]</code> is printed into the
terminal. Thefore, we can kill this process by sending its id on the
signal <code>to_kill</code>.
</p>
<p><pre class="code">
emit to_kill 1;;
</pre></p>
