<h4>What is ReactiveML?</h4>
<p>
  ReactiveML is a general purpose programming language extended with
  concurrency constructs to ease the programming of interactive
  systems. The concurrency model of the language originates from the
  synchronous model that is used to program real-time
  applications. Therefore, it takes advantages of the expressiveness
  and determinism of the model and removes the real-time constraints.
  Some <a href="<#ROOTDIR>/videos.html">videos</a> are presenting the language.

<h4>What are the uses of ReactiveML?</h4>
<p>
  ReactiveML is dedicated to the implementation of interactive systems
  as found in video games and simulation problems. For example, it has
  been used to
  <a href="<#ROOTDIR>/glonemo/">simulate power consumption in sensor
  networks</a> or to
  <a href="<#ROOTDIR>/reactive_asco/index.html">implement a sequencer
  for mixed music</a>. More examples are given in
  the <a href="<#ROOTDIR>/examples.html">examples page</a>.

<h4>How to learn ReactiveML?</h4>
<p>
  To start learning ReactiveML,
  an <a href="<#ROOTDIR>/tryrml/tryrml.html">interactive tutorial</a>
  is available
  online. A <a href="<#ROOTDIR>/documentation.html">documentation</a>
  explains how to compile ReactiveML programs and gives the syntax and
  intuitive semantics of the reactive
  constructs. Finally, <a href="<#ROOTDIR>/publications.html">academic
  publications</a> describes precisely the language, its static
  analysis and implementation.
