This virtual machine contains the ReactiveML distribution and the
examples accompanying the SAS14 paper entitled "Reactivity of
Cooperative Systems".

The user and password for this machine are:
  login: sas14
  password: sas14

To try the examples, in a terminal you can go into the sas14-examples
directory:
  $ cd ~/sas14-examples

Compile the examples:
  $ make

Then, display the type of each expression using emacs. For example,
you can open the file first_program.rml:
  $ emacs first_program.rml &

Put the cursor on the "clock" identifier (line 1, character 12).
Press Ctrl-c Ctrl-t. The type of the process is displayed at the
bottom of the window.

You can also display the behavior of each expression. For example, you
can put the cursor on the "loop" keyword (line 3, character 3).
Press Ctrl-c Ctrl-s.

To have more information on how to compile ReactiveML programs, you
can visit the ReactiveML web site:
  http://reactiveml.org/documentation.html
When compiling a ReactiveML file, adding the options -dreactivity
and -dtypes allows to display types and reactivity behaviors in emacs.

You can also use the on-line version of the toplevel:
