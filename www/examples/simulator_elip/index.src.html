	This paper presents a programming experiment of a complex network
	routing protocol for mobile ad hoc networks within the ReactiveML language.
	<br>
	Mobile ad hoc networks are highly dynamic networks characterized by
	the absence of physical infrastructure. In such networks, nodes are
	able to move, evolve concurrently and synchronize continuously with
	their neighbors.  Due to mobility, connections in the network can
	change dynamically and nodes can be added or removed at any time.  All
	these characteristics -- concurrency with many communications and the
	need of complex data-structure -- combined to our routing protocol
	specifications make the use of standard simulation tools (e.g., NS,
	OPNET) inadequate and network protocols appear to be very hard to
	program efficiently in conventional programming languages.
	<br>
	In this paper, we show that the synchronous reactive model, as
	introduced in the pioneering work of Boussinot, matters for
	programming such systems. This model provides adequate programming
	constructs -- namely synchronous parallel composition, broadcast
	communication and dynamic creation -- which allow for a natural
	implementation of the hard part of the simulation.
	<br>
	The implementation has been done in ReactiveML, an embedding of the reactive
	model inside a statically typed, strict functional language. ReactiveML
	provides reactive programming constructions with most of the features
	of OCaml. Moreover, it provides an efficient execution scheme for
	reactive constructs which made the simulation of real-size examples
	feasible. Experimental results show that the ReactiveML implementation is
	two orders of magnitude faster than the original C version; it was
	able to simulate more than 1000 nodes where the original C version
	failed (after 200 nodes) and compares favorably with the version programmed
	in NAB.
