<blockquote>
This example is the classical N-body problem where the number of objects
can change during the execution.
<br>
A new planet is created when the mouse
button is pressed.
The key 'k' removes the planets in the order of creation
and 's' removes the sun.
The execution can be suspended and resumed with the key 'p'.
<br>
This example has been used in a tutorial for the
ReactiveML toplevel (<a href="../../rmltop">see here</a>).
